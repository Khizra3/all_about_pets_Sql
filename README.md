# all_about_pets_Sql

This SQL assignment reminded me of my childhood pets 💙🐦 
I have always held a special place for birds in my heart! 

Requirement of this assignment was by using SQL queries analyse the number of pets with each owner, there vaccinations, if they had been through any procedures and amount that was spent by the owners.
The engaging part was when were to implement Joins, DDL and subqueries! 
Do you want to see how i did? Check out my repository, I am open to all kinds of feedback 😄
